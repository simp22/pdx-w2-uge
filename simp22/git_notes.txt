# Git Basics

What is git?
save repositories, snapshots
version control system
history of everything you do with your files
graph of ‘states’ in which your files has existed

Steps (Lifecycle, Simple Workflow): 
* modify, add, commit
1. Make changes (Dirty)
2. Add (Stage Changes)
3. Commit (Clean)

GIT COMMAND: commit
1. Changes made to each file on the stage
2. ID of the person who made the changes
3. Date and time the change was made
4. Brief message about the nature of the changes made
5. Universally unique ID for the set of changes (aka “Hash Code”, “SHA1 hashes”)

Terminal Fish Command Prompt:
x pink (aka “dirty”) in the prompt means changes have been made that have not been committed
checkmark green means everything is up-to-date
M yellow Modified un-staged
M green Modified added/staged

Commands:
git status Lists all new or modified files to be committed
git add [file] Snapshots the file in preparation for versioning (aka “Stage”)
git reset [file] Upstages the file but preserves its contents
git commit -m “[descriptive message]” Records file snapshots permanently in version history (aka “Clean”)

# Git Branches

git branch [branch-name] Creates a new branch
git branch Lists all local branches in the current repository
git checkout [branch-name] Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory
