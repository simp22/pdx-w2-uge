# Unix Intro

We are here to become a developer (app dev)

Apps need a home
- laptop, mobile device, browser, server
Majority of apps run on unix (de facto standard, stable, faster, open)

Unix is an operating system (multi-process, -user)
Developed by Ken Thompson & Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs
Most popular? Linux (case-sensitive op system)

Unix is great for developers:
- data as plain text files (ease of understanding amongst developers, better than binary)
- many small programs (text editor, music player, web browser, operating system)
—- this makes it easier to update
- input-output redirection (combine small understandable models into complex and interesting ways; little effort complex processes)

Unix Kernel
- Manages the hardware
- between other programs and the cpu, memory, devices (webcam, speakers)
- does all of this in a timely and organized fashion
- safe from hackers

Unix Shell (synonomous with the command line)
- another small program
- user interface (graphical, multi-touch, audible)
- the “shell” is like a nut and is the protective coating of the kernel (turtle shell)
